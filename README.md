## 🌟 Core Features

### 🔹 Advanced Processing Engines
*   **𝕏TV Core™**: Lightning-fast processing for standard files (up to 2GB) using the primary bot API.
*   **𝕏TV Pro™: Ephemeral Tunnels**: Seamless integration with a Premium Userbot session to handle **Large Files (>2GB up to 4GB)**. The system generates secure, temporary private tunnels for every single large file transfer, bypassing API limits, cache crashing, and `PEER_ID_INVALID` errors.
*   **Concurrency Control**: Global semaphore system prevents server overload by managing simultaneous downloads/uploads.

### 🔹 Intelligent Recognition
*   **MyFiles V2.1 Endgame Evolution**:
    *   **Inline Query Search:** Use `@YourBotName [search query]` anywhere to instantly pull up your files and share them via Deep Links!
    *   **Netflix-Style Visual Dashboard:** When viewing your files in `/myfiles`, the bot dynamically updates the interface to display the beautiful TMDb media poster inline.
    *   **Smart System Filenames:** Use `{title} ({year})` and other customizable templates to completely automate how your internal media files are saved and displayed.
    *   **Batch Actions (Multi-Select):** Easily move, send, or delete multiple files at once in your MyFiles dashboard via the new interactive checkmark system.
    *   **Dynamic Sorting:** Sort files by Newest, Oldest, or A-Z natively inside the MyFiles interface.
*   **Workflow Modes (Starter Setup)**: The bot greets users with an interactive, beautifully-formatted **Starter Setup Menu** when they join your Force-Sub channel or press `/start`. Users can pick their primary mode of operation:
    *   **🧠 Smart Media Mode**: Best for TV Shows & Movies. Automatically triggers the Auto-Detection Matrix and fetches TMDb metadata/posters natively.
    *   **⚡ Quick Rename Mode**: Best for Personal Videos, Anime, or generic files. Instantly bypasses all auto-detection logic and brings the user straight to the renaming prompt for rapid processing.
*   **Seamless Chat Cleanup**: The bot aggressively keeps the chat history pristine during the renaming process. It auto-deletes its own prompts and the user's replies, keeping the interface uncluttered.
*   **Auto-Detection Matrix**: Automatically scans filenames to detect Movie/Series titles, Years, Qualities, and Episode numbers with high accuracy.
*   **Smart Metadata Fetching**: Integration with **TMDb** to pull official titles, release years, and artwork. Now supports **Multilingual Metadata** (e.g. `de-DE`, `es-ES`), customizable per user in `/settings`!
*   **Automatic Archive Unpacking**: Automatically detects and downloads `.zip`, `.rar`, and `.7z` archives. It smartly identifies password-protected archives, prompts the user for the password, extracts the contents, and automatically feeds all valid media files directly into the batch processing queue!

### 🔹 Media Management & Workflows
*   **MyFiles System (`/myfiles`)**: A completely interactive, in-bot cloud storage management system! Every file processed by the bot is safely routed to hidden **Database Channels** and stored persistently.
    *   **Auto-Folders**: Automatically organizes your media into "Movies", "Series", or "Subtitles" folders using the advanced TMDb Auto-Detection Matrix.
    *   **Custom Folders**: Users can create their own custom folders, move files between them, and rename files natively.
    *   **Temporary vs Permanent Storage**: Admins can set precise plan limits for how many "Permanent" slots users receive. Files exceeding the limits are stored as "Temporary" and automatically cleared by the bot's background cleanup engine based on expiration rules.
    *   **Team Drive Mode**: In Non-Public Mode, the `/myfiles` system transforms into a single, shared "Global Workspace" where the entire team can securely access and manage all files across a unified global database channel.
*   **Multiple Dumb Channels & Sequential Batch Forwarding**: Configure multiple independent destination channels (globally or per-user). The bot automatically queues seasons or movie collections in bulk and strictly forwards them in sequential order (e.g., sorting series by Season/Episode and movies by resolution precedence: 2160p > 1080p > 720p > 480p).
*   **Unified Dumb Channel Wizard (v2)**: Adding a channel is now a clean 3-step flow — prompt → resolve → validate → save. Accepts forwarded messages (both legacy `forward_from_chat` and the newer `forward_origin.chat` APIs), `-100…` IDs, `@username`, bare usernames, `t.me/user` and `t.me/c/id` links. Rejects invite links with a helpful hint. Pre-save bot-permission validation with 5 distinct outcomes (admin+post / admin-no-post / member-no-admin / not-member / invalid) and a native Telegram "Add me as admin" deep-link button. Dedup check prevents duplicate adds. Quick-default shortcuts right after save let you flag the new channel as your Standard / Movie / Series default in one click.
*   **Smart Debounce Queue Manager**: Automatically sorts batched media uploads logically. Instead of simple alphabetical sorting, series are ordered by SxxExx and movies by quality precedence, preventing out-of-order uploads to your channels.
*   **Smart Timeout Queue**: Never get stuck waiting for crashed files. The sequential forwarding queue obeys a customizable timeout limit.
*   **Spam-Proof Forwarding**: Utilizing Pyrogram's `copy()` method, the bot cleanly removes 'Forwarded from' tags when sending to Dumb Channels, preventing Telegram's spam detection from flagging bulk media.
*   **Personal Media & Unlisted Content**: Direct menu options to bypass metadata databases for personal files, preserving original file extensions (like `.jpeg`) and letting you choose your preferred output format.
*   **Multipurpose File Utilities**: A complete in-bot suite of direct editing tools accessible via the **✨ Other Features** menu or their shortcut commands:
    *   **`/g` General Rename** — rename any file, bypass TMDb lookup.
    *   **`/a` Audio Metadata Editor** — edit MP3/FLAC title, artist, album, cover art.
    *   **`/c` File Converter Mega Edition** — category-based menus for Video (container swap, codec, audio/frame extract, GIF, audio FX, resolution/speed/reverse), Audio (format, bitrate, FX, bass boost), and Image (format, resize, rotate/flip, filters, compression). See the v1.5.2 changelog for the full op list.
    *   **`/w` Image Watermarker** — text or overlay-image watermarks.
    *   **`/s` Subtitle Extractor** — rip embedded subtitle tracks from MKV/MP4 containers.
    *   **`/t` Video Trimmer** — fast clip-cut without re-encoding, configurable start/end.
    *   **`/v` Voice Note Converter** — convert audio to Telegram's native voice-note format.
    *   **`/vn` Video Note Converter** — convert video to Telegram's round "video note" bubble format.
    *   **`/mi` MediaInfo** — detailed stream / codec / bitrate / duration / track breakdown for any media file.
    *   **`/yt` YouTube Tool** — see "YouTube Tool" section below.
*   **Dynamic Filename Templates**: Fully customizable filename structures via the Admin Panel for Movies, Series, and Subtitles using variables like `{Title}`, `{Year}`, `{Quality}`, `{Season}`, `{Episode}`, `{Season_Episode}`, `{Language}`, and `{Channel}`.

### 🔹 YouTube Tool (`/yt`)
*   **Five Download Modes**:
    *   **🎬 Video** — 360p / 480p / 720p / 1080p / Best-Available. Merges into MP4 with embedded thumbnail and FFmpeg metadata. Respects your plan's filesize cap (2 GB Standard, 4 GB with 𝕏TV Pro).
    *   **🎵 Audio (MP3)** — 128 / 192 / 320 kbps with embedded cover art.
    *   **🖼 Thumbnail** — highest-available JPG. Success screen offers `← Back to Menu` and `🔗 New Link` so you can chain multiple downloads without re-sending the URL.
    *   **📝 Subtitles / Captions** — 12 languages (EN/ES/FR/DE/HI/PT/IT/JA/KO/ZH/RU/AR), SRT output, automatic fallback to auto-captions if manual subs aren't available.
    *   **ℹ️ Video Info** — full yt-dlp metadata dump (title, uploader, duration, view count, formats, upload date, etc.).
*   **Live Progress**: status message edits every ~3 seconds with a visual progress bar, size, speed, ETA.
*   **Auto-URL Detection**: paste any `youtube.com` / `youtu.be` / `music.youtube.com` / `youtube-nocookie.com` link in chat without an active state and the bot offers to open the tool.
*   **🛡 Anti-Bot Hardening** — three defensive layers against YouTube's "sign in to confirm you're not a bot" guard:
    1. **Cookies**: admin command `/ytcookies` lets you upload a Netscape-format `cookies.txt`. The file is stored at `config/yt_cookies.txt` and used automatically for every subsequent request. Export with a browser extension like "Get cookies.txt LOCALLY" while logged into youtube.com.
    2. **Player-Client Fallback**: on bot-check failure the extractor automatically rotates through `default → ios → android → tv_embedded → web_embedded → mweb` before giving up.
    3. **Dedicated UI**: when YouTube still blocks the request the bot shows a clear in-chat help screen with a Retry button, an `🍪 Upload cookies` button (admins only), and cookie-status indicator — never a silent "Could not fetch info".

  ### 🔹 Torrent Downloader
*   **Multi-Provider Search Engine**: Searches **1337x**, **TorrentGalaxy**, and **LimeTorrents** concurrently and deduplicates results by info hash.
*   **Category-Based Filtering**: Narrow searches by Movies, TV Shows, Music, Games, Software, or Anime.
*   **Paginated Results**: Browse results 5 at a time with detailed info views (seeders, leechers, size, provider, date).
*   **aria2 Download Management**: Downloads via aria2 RPC with a real-time progress bar, speed, ETA, and cancel button.
*   **Plan-Based Size Limits**: Free users are limited to 2GB, Standard to 5GB, Deluxe has unlimited downloads.
*   **Smart File Selection**: After download, select which files to process with type icons, file sizes, and sort by size/name.
*   **Search History & Favorites**: Last 5 searches are saved for quick re-runs. Favorite torrents for instant access later.
*   **Download History**: Track all downloads with status (completed/failed/cancelled) and statistics.
*   **Pipeline Integration**: Selected files are automatically fed into the bot's standard processing pipeline (rename, metadata, upload).

### 🔹 Professional Metadata Injection
*   **FFmpeg Power**: Injects custom metadata (Title, Author, Artist, Copyright) directly into MKV/MP4 containers. The ultimate Telegram FFmpeg media processing bot.
*   **Branding**: Sets e.g. "Encoded by @YourChannel" and custom audio/subtitle track titles.
*   **Thumbnail Embedding**: Embeds custom or poster-based thumbnails into video files. Natively toggleable through the interactive settings menu (Auto-detect, Custom, or Deactivated).
*   **Album Support**: Handles multiple file uploads (albums) concurrently without issues.

### 🔹 Security & Privacy
*   **Anti-Hash Algorithm**: Generates unique, random captions for every file to prevent hash-based tracking or duplicate detection.
*   **Smart Force-Sub Setup**: Automatically detects when the bot is promoted to an Administrator in a channel, verifies permissions, and dynamically generates and saves an invite link for seamless Force-Sub configuration.
*   **Admin Feature Toggles**: Protect your server by toggling heavy CPU/RAM features (like Video Conversion and Watermarking) on or off globally.

## ☁️ Mirror-Leech

`MYFILES_VERSION 2.2` adds a **Mirror-Leech** subsystem that takes any
supported source and fans it out to one or more cloud destinations.
Deeply fused with MyFiles — every file in your cloud can be pushed to
Drive, MEGA, Pixeldrain, or another destination in one click.

### Sources (downloaders)

| Source | Notes |
|---|---|
| Direct HTTP(S) URL | streaming aiohttp, resume on Content-Length |
| YouTube + social (via yt-dlp) | any URL a yt-dlp extractor accepts |
| Telegram file (`tg:<chat>:<msg>`) | auto-used for MyFiles buttons |
| RSS feed | `.rss` / `.xml` / `/feed/` URLs; first enclosure via HTTP |

Peer-to-peer swarm links are out of scope on this branch and fall
through to a generic "unsupported source" message.

### Destinations (uploaders)

| Destination | Credentials |
|---|---|
| Google Drive | OAuth refresh_token + client_id + client_secret |
| Rclone (70+ backends) | `rclone.conf` body + default `remote:path` |
| MEGA.nz | email + password (requires `pip install mega.py`) |
| GoFile | anonymous OK, optional account token |
| Pixeldrain | anonymous OK, optional API key |
| Telegram | DM by default; set a channel id to override |
| Direct Download Link | needs `DDL_BASE_URL` env — one-time URLs |

### Usage

1. **Enable** under `/admin → ☁️ Mirror-Leech Config`. The feature stays
   off until an admin flips it on, and the toggle itself refuses to
   turn on until `SECRETS_KEY` is configured.
2. **Link providers** under `/settings → ☁️ Mirror-Leech` (public mode)
   or the same admin screen (non-public mode). Paste-to-link messages
   are deleted automatically after storage.
3. **Run a transfer**: `/ml <url>` picks a downloader automatically,
   prompts for destinations, and edits a single progress message in
   place until the task finishes.
4. **From MyFiles**: every single-file view has an "☁️ Mirror-Leech
   Options" button, and multi-select adds a "☁️ Mirror-Leech Selected
   (N)" batch action — each file queues its own task.
5. **Queue & cancel**: `/mlqueue` lists your last 20 tasks with inline
   cancel buttons.

### Secrets

Provider credentials are Fernet-encrypted at rest with `SECRETS_KEY`
(required — the bot refuses to store plaintext). Back the key up before
handing out logins; losing it means every user has to re-link their
providers.

**Easiest path — from inside the bot** (no CLI needed):

1. `/admin → 🩺 System Health & Statuses → ☁️ Mirror-Leech Config`
2. Tap **🎲 Generate SECRETS_KEY**. The bot posts a fresh key plus
   copy-paste instructions for every supported host (.env, Render,
   Railway, Koyeb, Zeabur, Heroku, Fly, Docker).
3. Install the key per your host, restart the bot, then tap
   **✅ Enable Mirror-Leech**.

**Manual alternative** (if you prefer a one-liner on your machine):

```bash
python -c "from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())"
```

### Admin layout

Operator panels for schema migrations, TMDb, and Mirror-Leech live
under a single entry so the main admin menu stays compact:

```
/admin → 🩺 System Health & Statuses
         ├─ 🩺 DB Schema Health
         ├─ 🎬 TMDb Status
         └─ ☁️ Mirror-Leech Config
```

The root status screens collapse into a short blockquote summary once
everything is configured — full onboarding copy only shows up while a
piece is still missing.

## 💎 Premium & Payment System

The 𝕏TV MediaStudio™ features a highly robust, business-class **Premium Subscription System** designed to monetize your bot and provide exclusive features to power users.

<details>
<summary><b>🌟 Premium System Highlights</b></summary>
<br>

*   **Multi-Tier Subscription Model**: Supports customizable **Standard** (⭐) and **Deluxe** (💎) premium plans. Admins can configure completely different daily egress limits, file processing limits, `/myfiles` folder limits, permanent storage capacities, and pricing for each tier.
*   **Donator Plan**: When a user's premium subscription expires, they are elegantly downgraded to the exclusive **Donator Plan**. This honors their support while applying free-tier restrictions and custom expiration logic for their overflow files.
*   **Feature Overrides**: Premium plans can be configured to bypass global "Admin Feature Toggles". For example, you can disable the heavy **Video Converter** for free users to save server CPU, but explicitly enable it for Premium Deluxe users!
*   **Priority Queue Processing**: Premium users bypass standard wait times via a specialized queue mechanism with reduced debounce delays and higher asynchronous concurrency limits.
*   **Automated Trials**: Admins can enable a customizable "Trial System", allowing free users to claim a 1-to-7 day premium trial directly from the bot.
*   **User Dashboard**: Premium users receive an aesthetically pleasing dashboard with heavy padding and decorative elements (`>`), displaying their current plan, expiry date, and active limits.

</details>

<details>
<summary>📈 <b>Unified Limit Management</b></summary>
Admins can easily set Free, Standard, and Deluxe plan limits (daily files, egress limits, custom folders, etc.) from a single unified menu under "Access & Limits".
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>💳 High-End Payment Gateways</b></summary>
<br>

*   **Telegram Stars Integration**: Seamlessly accepts native Telegram Stars using Pyrogram's `LabeledPrice` and raw MTProto API integration. Fast, secure, and native to the app!
*   **Professional Crypto Checkout**: Supports manual cryptocurrency payments. Admins can configure multiple specific wallet addresses (e.g., USDT, BTC, ETH) which are dynamically presented to the user during checkout.
*   **PayPal & UPI**: Direct manual payment integration for major fiat gateways.
*   **Automated Admin Approval Flow**: When a user makes a manual payment (Crypto/PayPal), the bot generates a unique Payment ID and logs it. Admins receive an instant notification with the receipt and can approve or deny the transaction with a single click, automatically applying the premium duration to the user.
*   **Dynamic Fiat Pricing**: Prices are displayed dynamically in both the user's local currency and USD equivalent (e.g., `2000 ₹ / $22.40`), with smart formatting for strong vs. weak currencies. Multi-month discounts (e.g., 3-month or 12-month) are calculated automatically.

</details>

---

## ⚙️ Configuration (.env)

Create a `.env` file in the root directory. You will need a **MongoDB** instance and **Pyrogram** session (optional for 4GB files).

### 🏁 Minimal setup (5 env vars → running bot)

Five vars and you're live. Everything else is optional.

```env
BOT_TOKEN=<from @BotFather>
API_ID=<from my.telegram.org>
API_HASH=<from my.telegram.org>
MAIN_URI=<MongoDB connection string — free Atlas tier works>
CEO_ID=<your Telegram user ID>
```

Features that need an API key (TMDb poster lookup, Mirror-Leech cloud
uploads) ship a friendly 🔒 notice when the key is missing and unlock
themselves the moment you add it — no redeploy needed for most keys.

### Full variable reference

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| `BOT_TOKEN` | ✅ | — | Bot token from @BotFather |
| `API_ID` | ✅ | — | Telegram API ID (my.telegram.org) |
| `API_HASH` | ✅ | — | Telegram API Hash (my.telegram.org) |
| `MAIN_URI` | ✅ | — | MongoDB connection string (free Atlas tier supported) |
| `CEO_ID` | ✅ | — | Your Telegram user ID — only this user can open `/admin` |
| `ADMIN_IDS` | ❌ | empty | Comma-separated extra admin user IDs |
| `PUBLIC_MODE` | ❌ | `false` | `true` to open the bot to everyone |
| `DEBUG_MODE` | ❌ | `false` | Verbose logs |
| `TMDB_API_KEY` | ❌ | empty | Unlocks title matching, posters, auto channel routing. Free key at https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api |
| `SECRETS_KEY` | ❌ | empty | Fernet key encrypting Mirror-Leech provider credentials. Required only when Mirror-Leech is enabled. |
| `YT_COOKIES_FILE` | ❌ | `config/yt_cookies.txt` | Absolute path to a Netscape YouTube cookies file. Admins can also upload at runtime via `/ytcookies`. |

> **Note:** The Torrent Downloader requires **aria2** to be installed and running as an RPC daemon on port 6800. See the Deployment Guide below for setup instructions.

## 🚀 𝕏TV Pro™ Setup (4GB File Support)

To bypass Telegram's standard 2GB bot upload limit, the **𝕏TV MediaStudio™** features a built-in **𝕏TV Pro™** mode. This mode uses a Premium Telegram account (Userbot) to act as a seamless tunnel for processing and delivering files up to 4GB.

<details>
<summary><b>🛠 How to Setup</b></summary>
<br>

1. Send `/admin` to your bot.
2. Click the **"🚀 Setup 𝕏TV Pro™"** button.
3. Follow the completely interactive, fast, and fail-safe setup guide. You will be asked to provide your **API ID**, **API Hash**, and **Phone Number**.
4. The bot will request a login code from Telegram. *(Enter the code with spaces, e.g., `1 2 3 4 5`, to avoid Telegram's security triggers).*
5. If 2FA is enabled, enter your password.
6. The bot will verify that the account has **Telegram Premium**. If successful, it securely saves the session credentials to the MongoDB database and hot-starts the Userbot instantly—**no restart required**.

> **Privacy & Ephemeral Tunneling (Market First!):** When processing a file > 2GB, the Premium Userbot creates a temporary, private "Ephemeral Tunnel" channel specific to that file. It uploads the transcoded file to this tunnel, and the Main Bot seamlessly copies the file from the tunnel directly to the user. After the transfer, the Userbot instantly deletes the temporary channel. This entirely bypasses standard bot API limitations, completely hides the Userbot's identity, prevents `PEER_ID_INVALID` caching errors, and removes any "Forwarded from" tags for a flawless delivery!

</details>

---

## 🌍 Public Mode vs Private Mode

The bot can operate in two distinct modes via the `PUBLIC_MODE` environment variable. **Choose a mode initially and stick with it**, as the database structure changes drastically between the two.

<details>
<summary><b>🔒 Private Mode (PUBLIC_MODE=False - Default)</b></summary>
<br>

* **Access**: Only the `CEO_ID` and `ADMIN_IDS` can use the bot.
* **Settings**: Global. The `/admin` command configures one global thumbnail, one set of filename templates, and one caption template for all files processed.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🔓 Public Mode (PUBLIC_MODE=True)</b></summary>
<br>

* **Access**: Anyone can use the bot!
* **User-Specific Settings**: Every user gets their own profile to customize thumbnails and templates without affecting others.

## 🛠 Deployment Guide

Welcome to the **𝕏TV MediaStudio™** deployment documentation! Because this bot processes media with **FFmpeg**, it consumes significant **RAM** and **Bandwidth (Egress)**. Keep this in mind when choosing a provider!

> **TL;DR** — set the 5 required env vars and click any deploy button below. `TMDB_API_KEY` is **optional**; the bot runs fine without it and shows a 🔒 notice on TMDb-dependent features until you add one. Same story for `SECRETS_KEY` (Mirror-Leech only).

<summary><b>🖥️ VPS & Dedicated Server Deployments</b></summary>
<br>

If you need maximum control, massive storage, and the cheapest bandwidth, deploying on a Virtual Private Server (VPS) via SSH is the best route.

### 1. Recommended Providers
*   **Oracle Cloud (Always Free ARM):** 4 CPU Cores, 24GB RAM, and **10TB of Free Egress Bandwidth** per month. (Create a Canonical Ubuntu Ampere A1 instance).
*   **Hetzner Cloud:** Incredible performance for the price. ~€4/mo gets you a dedicated IPv4 and **20TB of Bandwidth**. (Create an Ubuntu 24.04 server).
*   **Standard VPS:** DigitalOcean, AWS EC2, Linode, etc.

### 2. Step-by-Step Installation

**Step 1: Connect to your Server**
Connect to your server via SSH.
```bash
ssh root@YOUR_SERVER_IP
# Or if using an identity file like Oracle Cloud:
# ssh -i "path/to/key.key" ubuntu@YOUR_SERVER_IP
```

**Step 2: Update your System**
Ensure your package list is up to date.
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

**Step 3: Install Required Packages**
Install essential tools like `git` and `aria2` (required for the torrent engine).
```bash
sudo apt install git aria2 curl -y
```

**Step 4: Install Docker cleanly**
To avoid dependency conflicts (like `containerd.io` vs `containerd`), use the official Docker installation script.
```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sudo sh get-docker.sh
```

**Step 5: Setup the Torrent Daemon (Aria2c)**
Run `aria2c` in the background so the bot can communicate with it to process torrents.
```bash
aria2c --enable-rpc --rpc-listen-all --daemon
```

**Step 6: Download the Bot**
Clone the repository and enter the directory.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/davdxpx/XTV-MediaStudio.git
cd XTV-MediaStudio
```

**Step 7: Configure Settings**
Copy the example configuration file and edit it to include your tokens and MongoDB URI.
```bash
cp .env.example .env
nano .env
```
*(Save with `Ctrl+O`, `Enter`, and exit with `Ctrl+X`)*

**Step 8: Build and Run**
Start the bot using the Docker Compose plugin.
```bash
sudo docker compose up -d --build
```
*(You can view logs anytime using `sudo docker compose logs -f`)*
