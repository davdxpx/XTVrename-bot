"""plugins.myfiles — MyFiles feature package.

Re-exports the shared core helpers so callers keep the compact
``from plugins.myfiles import get_myfiles_state`` form.

Importing this package side-effect-registers the Pyrogram handlers in
``handlers`` and ``extras`` (Pyrogram plugin-discovery loads submodules
automatically — this explicit import makes the intent obvious for
static analyzers and for readers who don't know about the discovery).

Mode: BOTH (public + non-public).
