"""plugins.flow — the rename flow, split into logical submodules.

Before this refactor the whole rename / upload / confirm pipeline
lived in a single 3,500-line ``plugins/flow.py``. The file was split
into the following modules, each owning one concern:

 * ``sessions``            — file / batch state, expiry + debounce timers
 * ``type_selection``      — General / Movie / Series / Personal / Subtitle buttons
 * ``search``              — text input router + TMDb search + manual title
 * ``tmdb_selection``      — TMDb card pick, manual entry, send-as, ready-file
 * ``destinations``        — dest folder + dumb channel + language + cancel
 * ``upload``              — file upload dispatcher + batch orchestrator
 * ``archive``             — zip/rar/7z extraction flow
 * ``confirmation_screen`` — auto-detection + confirm screen + change menus
 * ``pickers``             — Codec / Audio / Specials multi-page pickers

Every submodule is imported below so its Pyrogram decorators run at
import time and register their handlers on the shared Client.

External callers (``main.py``, ``plugins/start.py``, various tools)
used to ``from plugins.flow import <X>``. We preserve those imports
by re-exporting the same symbols from here — no call-site changes
were needed in the rest of the codebase.
"""

# Submodule imports — each runs its @Client.on_* decorators at import
# time so Pyrogram picks up the handlers. ``sessions`` is side-effect-
# only (no decorators) but every other submodule depends on its shared
# dicts, so we always import it alongside the rest.
