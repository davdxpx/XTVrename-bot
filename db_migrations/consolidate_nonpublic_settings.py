"""Consolidate non-public per-user settings docs into global_settings.

Background
----------
Before the MediaStudio layout migration, ``Database._get_doc_id()`` in
non-public mode effectively ignored ``user_id`` and always addressed the
global settings document. The layout migration accidentally dropped that
special-case: if a caller passed ``user_id`` in non-public mode, writes
suddenly went to a ``user_<id>`` doc and reads split depending on who
asked.

Observed symptom
----------------
A single-tenant private bot had its dumb-channel list saved under
``user_<CEO_ID>`` (because the rename flow calls ``get_dumb_channels``
with ``user_id``), while ``/admin → Dumb Channels`` reads
``global_settings`` and therefore showed an empty list.

Fix
---
``_get_doc_id`` now forces ``global_settings`` in non-public mode. This
migration rescues any pre-existing per-user docs by deep-merging their
content into ``global_settings`` and then removing the per-user doc, so
both flows converge on the same source of truth.

Idempotent. Safe to call every boot. No-op when:
- ``PUBLIC_MODE=True`` (per-user docs are intentional there)
- no ``user_*`` docs exist
